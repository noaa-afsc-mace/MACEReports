\title{Create the old 'pre-selectivity era' biomass at age summary table for winter MACE cruise reports}
\usage{
build_shelikof_pre_selectivity_corrected_biomass_age_table()
}
\value{
A list with two items: item 1 is the Flextable table object, item 2 is the table caption.
}
\description{
Build the historic pre-selectivity corrected era table for the Shelikof Strait survey. This currently presents values from 1981-2007; these values are stored as static, formatted 'canned' values gleaned from historic cruise reports.If you want to change the static dataframe (for example, removing years as more selectivity-corrected values become available, the data is available within MACEReports package: see \code{shelikof_historic_biomass_by_age_1981_to_2007}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# build the table and the caption
shelikof_historical_biomass_age_list <- build_shelikof_pre_selectivity_corrected_biomass_age_table()

# pull out the table and caption from the list
shelikof_historical_biomass_age_table <- shelikof_historical_biomass_age_list[[1]]
shelikof_historical_biomass_age_caption <- shelikof_historical_biomass_age_list[[2]]
