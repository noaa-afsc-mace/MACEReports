\title{Create numbers at age table for MACE winter cruise reports}
\usage{
build_numbers_at_age_table_winter_goa(biomass_nums_age_data, region_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{biomass_nums_age_data}{The name of the dataframe that contains all the abundance-at-age values;
this dataframe is created in the cruise report markdown process using the function
\code{get_biomass_and_nums_age_data_function.R}; this provides all the data that is then used to create a
dataframe named \code{shelikof_sel_corr_surveys_biomass_nums_age}. This dataframe is the easiest input to
\code{build_numbers_at_age_table_winter_goa} function.}

\item{region_name}{The name of the reporting region that you want to include in this table
(generally "Shelikof Strait" in winter GOA reports)}
}
\value{
A list with two items: item 1 is the Flextable table object, item 2 is the table caption.
}
\description{
Build the pollock numbers-at-age table used in winter GOA reports. The data used here is usually
limited to the 'selectivity-corrected era' within Shelikof Strait (i.e. 2008-current). This function will report all
ages from 1-18, and will do so for any region that was defined for the analysis.
If you have an especially old age class (>18 years old), the table will report to this age as opposed
to the nomimal age 1- age 18 range.

# build the table and the caption

  biomass_nums_age_data = shelikof_sel_corr_surveys_biomass_nums_age,
  region_name = "Shelikof Strait"
)

# pull out the table and caption from the list
nums_age_table <- nums_age_table_list[[1]]
nums_age_caption <- nums_age_table_list[[2]]
