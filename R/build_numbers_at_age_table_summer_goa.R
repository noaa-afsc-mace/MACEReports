#' @title Create numbers at age table for MACE summer GOA cruise reports
#' @description Build the pollock numbers-at-age table used in summer GOA reports. This will report numbers at
#' age (millions of fish) for ages from 1- maximum reported age in the survey,
#' and will do so for each report number (i.e. survey region) that was defined for the analysis.
#' @param biomass_nums_age_data The name of the dataframe that contains the pollock numbers-at-age data;
#' this dataframe is created in the cruise report markdown process using the function
#' \code{get_biomass_and_nums_age_data_function.R}; this provides all the data that is used to create
#' a 'current survey only/pollock only' dataframe named \code{current_survey_pollock_biomass_nums_age}.
#' This dataframe is the easiest input to the \code{build_numbers_at_age_table_summer_goa} function.
#' @return A list with two items: item 1 is the Flextable table object, item 2 is the table caption.
