\title{Create biomass at age table for MACE summer GOA cruise reports}
\usage{
build_biomass_at_age_table_summer_goa(biomass_nums_age_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{biomass_nums_age_data}{The name of the dataframe that contains the pollock biomass-at-age data;
this dataframe is created in the cruise report markdown process using the function
\code{get_biomass_and_nums_age_data_function.R}; this provides all the data that is used to create
a 'current survey only/pollock only' dataframe named \code{current_survey_pollock_biomass_nums_age}.
This dataframe is the easiest input to the \code{build_biomass_at_age_table_summer_goa} function.}
}
\value{
A list with two items: item 1 is the Flextable table object, item 2 is the table caption.
}
\description{
Build the pollock biomass-at-age table used in summer GOA reports. This will report biomass at
age for ages from 1- maximum reported age in the survey, and will do so for each report number (i.e. survey region)
that was defined for the analysis.
}

\dontrun{
# build the table and caption

#
biomass_at_age_table <- biomass_at_age_table_list[[1]]
biomass_at_age_caption <- biomass_at_age_table_list[[2]]
