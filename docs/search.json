Right now, can make maps following regions: ‘shelikof’, ‘summer_goa’, ‘core_ebs’, ‘sca’ (.e. Shelikof Strait winter survey, Summer GOA survey, Summer EBS survey, summer EBS survey within sea lion conservation area). must define domain interpolation. practical terms, means someone needs build polygon defines domain. want create interpolations elsewhere, can work add polygon . define resolution want interpolate.
